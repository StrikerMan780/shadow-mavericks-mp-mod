The Shadow Mavericks MP Mod ("SMMP" for short, MP standing for both Multiplayer & Multipurpose.) is an ever-evolving, wild and wacky collection of our clan's maps and ideas.

As the name would suggest, it has more than one purpose; It's part weapons mod, part HD visual enhancement, part COOP/DM/DUEL/CTF/LMS map pack, part 'headquarters' mod, part class-based slugfest, part monster replacement, part joke mod, and part whatever-the-fuck-we-want. It's primary purpose though is to provide us with a base for limitless experimentation, and to allow us to make something very fun, interactive, full of humor, and addicting to play.

It doesn't follow any rules, it never takes itself too seriously, and is filled with over-the-top, bizarre, and often hilarious weapons, enemies, sounds, maps, jokes, and the occasional internet meme reference.

The mod is still considered a beta, due to the fact that a majority of the maps are incomplete or in the process of a major overhaul. [SM] members can contribute their own content such as maps, artwork, sounds, and code where I (StrikerMan780) will merge them into the project if considered high enough quality.
