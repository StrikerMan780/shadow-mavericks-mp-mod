Make marine class unskinnable, put Tourettes Guy in as another class.
Make the Tourettes Guy's Demonic Power ability him screaming "FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!" and every monster on screen blowing up.
FUUUUCK attack would only do 1/4 damage to players in DM, for balance.
Explosions from FUUUUUCK attack would not harm the Tourettes Guy himself to prevent accidental suicides.
In order to prevent spam of the attack, Tourettes guy would have a "Rage" meter. It raises by 1 unit when he takes damage.
once the rage meter is full, he can use the attack at the cost of 100dp.
